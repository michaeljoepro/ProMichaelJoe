Hello Wurld,

I have no idea what i'm doing yet but i type really fast so I figured i should give this a try. I spent a marvelous amount of time reading what seemed to be mumbo gumbo until the voices in my head said this is actually a lot harder so i said, run it.

And so now i'm a coder, right? cool.
